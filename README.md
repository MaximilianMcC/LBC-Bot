# Long Bay College Discord Bot
*This is not an official Long Bay College bot*


## Running your own copy of the bot
If you want to download and run your own coppy of the bot then you need to make a `config.json` file in the root directory. This is a template version:
```json
{
    "token": "<BOT TOKEN>",
    "lbcapi": "<URL TO THE LONG BAY NOTICES API>",
    "guilds": [<LIST OF SERVER GUILDS>]
}
```
The api is currently not avalible to stop people from stealing the bot. A token system will be created later to access the API.
