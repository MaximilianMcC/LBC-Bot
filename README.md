# Long Bay College Discord Bot
*This is not an official Long Bay College bot*


## Running your own copy of the bot
If you want to download and run your own coppy of the bot then you need to make a `config.json` file in the root directory. This is a template version:
```json
{
    "token": "bot token",
    "lbcapi": "url to lbc api",
    "guilds": [List of guilds for testing],
    "noticesChannel" noticesChannelId
}
```
The api is currently not avalible to stop people from stealing the bot. A token system will be created later to access the API.
